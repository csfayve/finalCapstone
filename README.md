# watch_next.py

I created a function that returns which movie a user would watch next. (As an example I picked "Planed Hulk")
All the user has to do is copy and paste a description of his favourite movie and the function will compare it with the writen in the function descriptions.
It will than gives the title of the movie with the most similar plot. 

The project is useful for people who struggle with picking the next movie to watch!

## How to use it:
1. All you have to do is copy my code and paste it to your program (I used Visual Studio Code)
2. You can change the list of given descriptions to descriptions of movies you are interested with! (The list is placed under the *# description of other movies* comment)
3. Than run it and watch similar moveis to your favourite one!

### I created the function by myself!
